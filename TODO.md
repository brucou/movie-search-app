! redo the app with react-state-driven and state-transducer
  - exactly same as implementation
  - test that and find the concurrency bugs
  - don't use preprocessor (maybe should have a no proprocessor thing to avoid rxjs or have a 
  dummy implementation of the interface)
- then app with full and correct specs (no design bugs)
  - NO, not necessary
