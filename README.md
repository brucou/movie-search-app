# Motivation
This demo aims at showing how state machines can be used to modelize reactive systems, in 
particular user interfaces. They have long been used for embedded systems, in particular for 
safety-critical software.

Our stack consists of :
 - `cyclejs` as central controller
- `react` as DOM library
- `react-transducer` as state machine library
- `rxjs` to handle events
