  - 3.3.3 Function specifications - difference between model-driven (use for specification i.e. 
  implementation) and model-based (used for testing for instance, does not need same level of 
  details)
  -  Testing strategy ; coverage etc.
  - in general a pretty clearly explained thesis, even if the decision tables approach (2017
