# Learnt
- CATCH ERRORS in promises and systematically LOG THEM
  - a lot of the time I spent with the issues below are due to error swallowing
- jsx camelcase => uncamelled in html
  - data-activePage => data-active-page
  - onClick => onclick
- className => class
- querySelectorAll returns a NodeList not an array. Does not have a map method, but a forEach only
- setImmediate does not exist in the browser. So react-testing-library bugs. must mock 
setImmediate for setTimeout 0
- apparently it is `oninput` not `onchange` for change in input fields
- AVOID mispelling when pasting like lost ' or " SUPER ANNOYING
- BUG with `` : ${string}\> includes the \ inside the string
- be careful with dom-testing-library to put the arguments in the right position - no error 
signalling most of the time
  - don't use so much waitForDomChange if it runs after the DOM is changed then it detects 
  nothing. It can work if for isntance images are loaded async, and the dom changes but imagees 
  are not loaded yet, problem!! use `wait` and `getByTestId` if necessary rather than 
  `waitForElement`, that makes only one API to learn 
- STATE!!
  - made the mistake to run several tests without resetting the state of the app in the init
- be careful with dom-testing-library with stuff happening on the same data-test-id
  - that makes it indeterminate to discriminate with wait. It sometimes get the first stuff 
  happenned, sometimes after the second...
  - make a specific test id to discriminate!
- using innerHTML for rendering means that I loose focus on input fields
  - generally i loose the DOM state by recreating the DOM!!!
- TESTS with dom-library : 
  - use waiForElement rather than wait by default (when waiting for element to appear)
- transducers API
  - transducers are pipe transformers. So it is not possible to do a startWith. startWith is a 
  producer transformer!
  - same goes for merge, which is also a producer transformer. Reason is transformer kick in when
   a value is already emitted. So any merging logic would have to wait for a value to come in and
    activate the transducer!! 
    - transduce(coll, xform, reducer, init?) â€” Like reduce, but apply xform to each value before passing to reducer. If init is not specify it will attempt to get it from reducer.
    - transducer (xform) needs a reducer to tell it how to build the result. In other words, it is 
    monoid?
    - xform takes a reducer : xform(reducer) is a function (result, x) which returns a new result. So
     x is the new value here, and result is the reduced value from the old result value
    - xform (reducer) is a reducer!! i.e. a transducer!!
    - so reducer here is the original reducer, the building reducer!!
    - so coll knows how to iterate, reducer knows how to build results, xform transforms reducers

# Learnt Config
- qunit better included in the html if webpack (the import works, but the function QUnit.module 
etc. do not produce any effect)
- had to put in webpack.config.js to avoid annoying issues with react-app-presets or whatever 
that was coming from...,. 
```
process.env.BABEL_ENV = 'development';
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development';
```
and also put a .babelrc
```javascript
{
  "presets": ["@babel/env", "react-app"]
}
```

# http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/contents/
- explain to him that he is doing state machine really in his react patterns

# DSL for state machines
- I can use state litterals!!! pass action functions in ${} it works!!! incredible

Guards:
---
function xxx()
---

Actions :
---
function xxx(){}
test if closure can be used this is evaluated so probably ??
---
Given ST1, When EV And guard THEN xxx
or 
ST1 => ST2 when EV AND guard
ST1 => ST2 on EV if guard

amazing world
